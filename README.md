## What is it?
It is a console version of the popular game Tic-Tac-Toe. Tic-tac-toe is a game for two players who take turns marking the spaces in a three-by-three grid with X or O. The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner. In this game, the players can choose whatever symbol they like, the score is registered automatically and at the end you can choose to reset the game with the same players or play again and choose different players and reset the score.
